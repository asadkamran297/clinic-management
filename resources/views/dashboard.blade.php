        The Mexican crime drama follows the murder of a young girl named Sara Guzman, who was connected with a powerful crime family the Lazcanos and was mysteriously killed in a parasailing accident. Her brother, Alex Guzman was charged for her murder under false pretenses. Returning from prison after six years, Alex seeks revenge against the Lazcanos who he believes is responsible for his sister’s murder. While the storyline seemed like a typical revenge story at the beginning, things become bloodier, leaving everyone scratching their heads and wondering who exactly killed Sara.



        Surprise! Surprise! Season 2 just dropped on Netflix and took the entire internet by storm. And as expected, the season finale leaves viewers with more questions than answers. But don’t worry, it seems like the season 3 is already in the works.



        Here’s everything we know about season 3 of Who Killed Sara?



        What is the release date of season 3 of Who Killed Sara?



        The streaming giant hasn’t yet revealed any details about the future of the series. With season 2 having dropped just yesterday, it’s probably too soon to predict the release date of season 3. But… We have our reasons to believe season 3 will most likely happen. Netflix renewed the series for a second season just within five days of its streaming. So we can assume that season 3 will mostly be a 2021 release. We will update this blog with its release details as soon as get the green light. So stay tuned!
